# 🚀 Idle Master Extended

Get your [Steam Trading Cards](https://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/) the quickest possible way.


## ❓ But what is Idle Master Extended?

🔧 This is a fork of the **discontinued** [Idle Master](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master) project by [jshackles](https://github.com/jshackles) (also known for [Enhanced Steam](https://github.com/jshackles/Enhanced_Steam)):

> This program will determine which of your Steam games still have Steam Trading Card drops remaining, and will go through each application to simulate you being “in-game” so that cards will drop. It will check periodically to see if the game you’re idling has card drops remaining. When only one drop remains, it will start checking more frequently. When the game you’re idling has no more cards, it’ll move on to the next game. When no more cards are available, the program will terminate. 
> 
> This application requires Steam to be open and for you to be logged in.  This program is now being developed exclusively for Microsoft Windows. Non-Windows versions are available in the [Python repository](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master_py) but may be deprecated or feature incomplete.
